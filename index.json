ML algorithms were performed to establish a predictive model based on selected metabolites, which was further optimized by a quantitative targeted metabolomics method and validated in an independent validation cohort with 97 participants with InGF and 139 participants with FrGF.\nDifferential metabolites between InGF and FrGF groups were identified. Top dysregulated pathways included carbohydrates, amino acids, bile acids, and nucleotide metabolism. Subnetworks with maximum disturbances in the global metabolic networks featured cross-talk between purine metabolism and caffeine metabolism, as well as interactions among pathways involving primary bile acid biosynthesis, taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, suggesting epigenetic modifications and gut microbiome in metabolic alterations underlying InGF and FrGF.\nPotential metabolite biomarkers were identified using ML-based multivariable selection and further validated by targeted metabolomics. Area under receiver operating characteristics curve for differentiating InGF and FrGF achieved 0.88 and 0.67 for the discovery and validation cohorts, respectively.\nIn summary, Systematic metabolic alterations underlie InGF and FrGF, and distinct profiles are associated with differences in gout flare frequencies. Predictive modeling based on selected metabolites from metabolomics can differentiate InGF and FrGF.\n","date":1742083200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1742083200,"objectID":"e3368ff682532faf03133bef714dad28","permalink":"https://example.com/project/gout-biomarker/","publishdate":"2025-03-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/gout-biomarker/","section":"project","summary":"Metabolomics and Machine Learning Identify Metabolic Differences and Potential Biomarkers for Frequent versus Infrequent Gout Flares","tags":["Biomarkers"],"title":"Gout Biomarkers","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"from IPython.core.display import Image Image(\u0026#39;https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo-master-v3-TM-flattened.png\u0026#39;) print(\u0026#34;Welcome to Academic!\u0026#34;) Welcome to Academic!

You can focus on the content and Wowchemy handles the rest.\nHighlight your code snippets, take notes on math classes, and draw diagrams from textual representation.\nOn this page, you‚Äôll find some examples of the types of technical content that can be rendered with Wowchemy.\nExamples Code Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for highlighting code syntax. You can customize the styles under the syntax_highlighter option in your config/_default/params.yaml file.\n```python import pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026#34;data.csv\u0026#34;) data.head() ``` renders as\nimport pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026#34;data.csv\u0026#34;) data.head() Mindmaps Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for mindmaps.\nSimply insert a Markdown markmap code block and optionally set the height of the mindmap as shown in the example below.\nA simple mindmap defined as a Markdown list:\n```markmap {height=\u0026#34;200px\u0026#34;} - Hugo Modules - wowchemy - blox-plugins-netlify - blox-plugins-netlify-cms - blox-plugins-reveal ``` renders as\n- Hugo Modules - wowchemy - blox-plugins-netlify - blox-plugins-netlify-cms - blox-plugins-reveal A more advanced mindmap with formatting, code blocks, and math:\n```markmap - Mindmaps - Links - [Wowchemy Docs](https://docs.hugoblox.com/) - [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/z8wNYzb) - [GitHub](https://github.com/HugoBlox/hugo-blox-builder) - Features - Markdown formatting - **inline** ~~text~~ *styles* - multiline text - `inline code` - ```js console.log(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;); console.log(\u0026#39;code block\u0026#39;); ``` - Math: $x = {-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\over 2a}$ ``` renders as\n- Mindmaps - Links - [Wowchemy Docs](https://docs.hugoblox.com/) - [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/z8wNYzb) - [GitHub](https://github.com/HugoBlox/hugo-blox-builder) - Features - Markdown formatting - **inline** ~~text~~ *styles* - multiline text - `inline code` - ```js console.log(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;); console.log(\u0026#39;code block\u0026#39;); ``` - Math: $x = {-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\over 2a}$ Charts Wowchemy supports the popular Plotly format for interactive charts.\nSave your Plotly JSON in your page folder, for example line-chart.json, and then add the {{\u0026lt; chart data=\u0026#34;line-chart\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} shortcode where you would like the chart to appear.\nDemo:\nYou might also find the Plotly JSON Editor useful.\nMath Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for $\\LaTeX$ math.
